MODAC Potential Config
early design notes for where configuration data is kept.
all of it is python files

moData:
  numKType
  numBinaryOut
  numAD24
  numAD16

  CSV support to moCSV?

kilnControl/Kiln
  enableKilnControl
  enableEStop

kilnControl/kilnConfig
  distanceEpsilon
  temperatureEpsilon
  relayPower (gpio of 12v power to relays)
plus lots more...
# heaters: idxs of BinaryOut pins
heater_lower = 1
heater_middle = 2
heater_upper = 3
heaters = [0, heater_lower, heater_middle, heater_upper]

# fans are wired via 
fan_support = 11  # jet to support glass
fan_exhaust = 10  # heat exhaust fan

#####################
# kType thermocouples: may or may not be wired separate or combined
# three ktypes are defined over there, and reported by the kType entry in moData
# these are indices into the moData( kTypeKey ) array
