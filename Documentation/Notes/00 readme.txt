Notes folder for MODAC
contains cryptic note files written by Jerry Isdale during development
collected here for posterity and reference someday
some info needs to migrate to official documentation

Offical docs started as LibreOffice Docs, then moved to Google Docs in Google Drive
then moved back and forth, run thru a converter that sorta makes them available on github somewhere
