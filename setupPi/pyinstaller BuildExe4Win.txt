pyinstaller

To create an EXE for Win10 we use pyinstaller...
    http://www.pyinstaller.org/
	https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/

from the dataToFish site:
1) add python to Win10path
2) add pyinstaller  (pip install pyinstaller)
3) create folder holding the py code
4) in sh, cd to folder ^^ and run
   pyinstaller --onefile moTkShell.py

this creates a dist folder, which will contain the executable moTkShell.executable
assuming your python install has all the right parts

created makeClient.sh in modac1 repo to simplify this
