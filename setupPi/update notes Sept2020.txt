Sept Notes... 
but for now the August notes - approx 180 lines
---------------------------------



updating to python3.7 so we can properly support tkinker in sync with Windows version

18Aug...
pynng needs this environment var
.bash.rc
  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1

then there was a path thing getting scipy running so i ...

  sudo ln -s /usr/include/python3.7m ./python3.7m

scipy seems to require Fortran so
  sudo apt install gfortran

then retry 
   sudo pip3 install scipy
takes a Loooooong time

gonna try a build from scratch - pi Buster starts at 3.7.3 so that would be better

---------------------------
restarting 19 Aug w fresh SD linux
first boot,
  set wifi, locale
  raspi-config - set interfaces spi i2c
copy lines from setupPi.sh
dont do scipy just yet.
seems to go ok until 
  sudo pip3 install pylint
gives errors....
---------------------  
Installing collected packages: toml, typed-ast, wrapt, lazy-object-proxy, astroid, pylint

    Uninstalling typed-ast-1.3.1:
      Successfully uninstalled typed-ast-1.3.1
  Attempting uninstall: wrapt
    Found existing installation: wrapt 1.10.11
ERROR: Cannot uninstall 'wrapt'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.
---------------------  
but do we really need pylint?
does pynng require cmake?
  apparently yes it does.
didnt link include dir yet
pynng gives large errors...
see Fail_installPynng1.txt
try again w cmake installed
ok that worked..
next fail is scipy
sudo pip3 install --upgrade scipy

stackOverflow article recommends (may18)
  sudo apt install -y libblas3 liblapack3 liblapack-dev libblas-dev
  sudo apt install -y gfortran
  sudo apt install -y libatlas-base-dev
older 2016 so says build from source
but we try the apt installs, except gfortran
nope needs fortran
runs waaay to long.
other article says needs to increase swap

  sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
  sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
  CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024
  sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
  reboot
--- need to read more on dphys-swapfile .. 
Build scipy etc
# apk add --no-cache g++ gfortran openblas-dev bash
   sudo pip install --no-cache-dir scipy
AND IT WORKED!!
now to test
---------
update network
   sudo cp ~/Desktop/setupPi/hosts /etc
   sudo cp  ~/Desktop/setupPi/hostname /etc
   sudo cp  ~/Desktop/setupPi/dhcpcd.conf /etc

Need /etc/dhcpcd.conf
static ip of eth0
----------
testCode/nngTest  pair0Test.py
fails because a library is not found "atomic_fetch_sub"
needs the .bashrc 
  cp ~/Desktop/setupPi/.bashrc ~

and then pair0 works

acid test - run server
woops something needs colorlog... ahh that was moLogger... thought I removed it
ugh get pyCharm, again
  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux
  snap doesnt seem to work
sudo apt-get install snap
sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic

so download and extract from tar and put tar in /usr/loca/bin/pycharm...
ahhh needs java JDK
  sudo apt install default-jdk
https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/Compiling+File+Watcher
copied stuff to setupPi as pycharmNotifier
run make.sh (may be there)
cp to where ever pycharm was installed

now how to get the icon back ... Tools/Create Desktop Entry...
----
forgot the theermocouple
  sudo pip3 install thermocouples_reference 
because it needed scipy and thus all that other crap
pyCharm cant run nng stuff w/o the LD env var
    LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1
hmm, editing the pyCharm project settings for environment doesnt do it
maybe stuffing it into pycharm.sh ??
nope
runs ok from command line
create pythonLD.sh in /etc/profile.d
   export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1
reboot
File>settings>Build, Exec...>Console>PythonConsole... 
add it on environmetn Variables space
Ok solution...
  Project settings, env vars = open editor or use ; to separate values
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1;LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1
set that for python file tempalate and it works
---------------------------------

rebuilt my rPi hardware to diagnose and repair the AD115 issues with Waiakoa kiln version
my pi has ad1115 on its i2c but wo differential repeater.
borrowing the Enviro sensor from Waiakoa hw

running in newer linux setup
...
trying TKShell also on my Desktop PC
and on the linux
and on the MorphPc
